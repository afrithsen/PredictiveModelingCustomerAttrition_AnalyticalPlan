# Predictive Modeling Customer Attrition: Analytical Plan <br>
In this project, I am working on developing a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of attrition, using a dataset containing information about approximately 10,000 customers. My analytical plan includes identifying key business variables such as customer demongraphics, transaction history, and engagement patterns, while addressing challenges including class imbalance and potential overfitting. Currently, I am building and evaluating multiple supervised learning models - including logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbors - to determine the most effective model. My final analysis will provide actionable insights and recommendations to inform targeted retention strategies.
